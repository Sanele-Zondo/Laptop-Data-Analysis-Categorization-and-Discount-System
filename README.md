## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
This project involves scraping laptop data from a website, cleaning and transforming it, categorizing laptops into work, gaming, and education categories, applying discounts based on certain criteria, and building a model to automate the categorization. The project concludes by visualizing the data and saving it into an SQL database for further analysis.

### Objective
The main objective is to automate the process of extracting, cleaning, categorizing, and analyzing laptop data, applying discounts where applicable, and visualizing insights. The data will then be stored in a structured format in an SQL database.

### Step-by-Step Guide
- Scrape the laptop data from the website
- Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, format data types)
- Extract relevant features and categories using regex
- Apply the machine learning model to categorize laptops
- Build a discounting system for each category (work, gaming, education)
- Visualize the categorized data and the price distribution with Matplotlib
- Push the cleaned and transformed data to SQL

## 2. Data Collection

### Source
Data is scraped from an e-commerce website: [Webscraper Test Site](https://webscraper.io/test-sites), listing laptops with detailed specifications, prices, and other features.

### Tools Used
- **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests**: Used for scraping data from HTML pages.
- Extract key attributes such as model name, price, specifications (e.g., RAM, processor, GPU), and other product details.
